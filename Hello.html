    <p>270 Park Avenue, also known as the JPMorgan Chase Tower and the Union Carbide Building, was a skyscraper in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Built in 1960 for Union Carbide, it was designed by the architects Gordon Bunshaft and Natalie de Blois of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). The 52-story skyscraper, which later became the global headquarters for JPMorgan Chase, was demolished in 2021 to make way for a taller skyscraper at the same address. At that time, the Union Carbide Building was the tallest voluntarily demolished building in the world. The building occupied a full city block bounded by Madison Avenue, 48th Street, Park Avenue, and 47th Street. It included a 52-story tower facing Park Avenue to the east and a 12-story annex facing Madison Avenue to the west, along with public plazas. About two-thirds of 270 Park Avenue was built atop two levels of underground railroad tracks, which feed into the nearby Grand Central Terminal. (Full article...)</p>
